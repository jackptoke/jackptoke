## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## What am I up to?
Currently I am completing my Data Engineering Bootcamp with Le Wagon.  I am working on the final project, which is an ETL pipeline processing real estate data from an API using **Apache Airflow**, **DBT**, **Apache Spark** and **Streamlit**.  For the data warehouse, I'll be using **Minio**, **Snowflake** and **Postgres**.
