## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Who am I?
In the past two years, I have built an Android mobile solution that streamlined warehouse operations and eliminated human errors. Previously, the company was losing between $1-$2 million annually because wrong products were being shipped to customers, requiring orders to be redone or reshipped. The Android solution I developed not only eradicated these errors but also streamlined the entire process by reducing manual documentation. As an added benefit, the company was able to redeploy several workers to other areas.
The second project I took on was integrating a Siemens electrical harness design software with the company's existing manufacturing software. The Siemens software was a requirement imposed by a customer, a major Australian truck manufacturer. This requirement forced engineers to create each electrical harness design twice: once in the Siemens software and again in the legacy system used throughout the manufacturing process. The solution I developed automatically transferred data from the Siemens system into the other software. This saved the engineers from duplicating their work and significantly reduced the potential for errors. Depending on complexity, each design took anywhere from one day to a few months to complete.
Toward the end of that project, while reflecting on how I could build similar solutions that were less tightly coupled, I discovered Data Engineering. I was immediately drawn to its plethora of tools and methodologies and decided to pursue a career as a Data Engineer. I enjoy the process of breaking down complex problems and developing solutions that improve and streamline business operations. I am not tied to a specific tech stack or platform; instead, I focus on learning the tools necessary to solve the business problem at hand.

## Data Engineering Skills
I build robust ELT pipelines using **Dagster**/**Airflow**, **DBT** and **DuckDB**/**Snowflake**/**BigQuery**/**AWS S3**.  If a dashboard is required, I am comfortable with **Streamlit**.

## Collaboration
If you are interested in Real Estate, I am working on a data solution that will provide insights for anyone looking to invest or buy properties in Australia.  I'm looking for someone with Web Development skills that can build a user-friendly UI.
